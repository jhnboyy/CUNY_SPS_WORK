    "A new credit scoring system has been developed to predict the likelihood of loan defaults. The system has a 90% sensitivity, meaning that it correctly identifies 90% of those who will default on their loans. It also has a 95% specificity, meaning that it correctly identifies 95% of those who will not default. The default rate among borrowers is 2%. Given these prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity estimates, what is the probability that a borrower flagged by the system as likely to default will actually default? \n",

    "2: Inventory Management in a Warehouse\n",
    "Scenario: A warehouse tracks the inventory levels of a particular product using a Markov Chain model. The inventory levels are categorized into three states:\n",
    " - State 1: High inventory (More than 100 units in stock).\n",
    " - State 2: Medium inventory (Between 50 and 100 units in stock).\n",
    " - State 3: Low inventory (Less than 50 units in stock).\n",
    " \n",
    "The warehouse has the following transition probabilities for inventory levels from one month to the next:\n",
    " - From State 1 (High): 70% stay in State 1, 25% move to State 2, and 5% move to State 3.\n",
    " - From State 2 (Medium): 20% move to State 1, 50% stay in State 2, and 30% move to State 3.\n",
    " - From State 3 (Low): 10% move to State 1, 40% move to State 2, and 50% stay in State 3.\n",
    " \n",
    "The warehouse management wants to optimize its restocking strategy by understanding the long-term distribution of inventory levels.\n",

    "Question: \n",
    "- (a) Construct the transition matrix for this Markov Chain. \n",
    "- (b) If the warehouse starts with a high inventory level (State 1), what is the probability that it will eventually end up in a low inventory level (State 3)? \n",
    "- (c) Determine the steady-state distribution of this Markov Chain. What is the long-term expected proportion of time that the warehouse will spend in each inventory state?"
