    "##### Decision Tree Ensembles to Predict Coronavirus Disease 2019 Infection: A Comparative Study (https://www.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2021/5550344/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- This paper looked at COvid-19 in patients and attempted to use decision tree modeling on lab results and patient age, with imbalanced outcome considerations, for properly predicting COVID diagnosis in patients. There were 5644 total patients in the original data, with 600 final patients being kept in the study using about 18 different lab biomarker measurements. Of the 600 patents used, 520 were negative and 80 were positive. So about a 13% positivity rate. Data was imbalanced so RUS and SMOTE were used, and the multiple types of Classifier methods were used to obtain results. Overall the best modeling technique was random forest having highest accuracy. with RUSBagging, Balanced Random ForestBalanced, and XGBoost with RUS doing well too.\n",

    "##### A novel approach to predict COVID-19 using support vector machine (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8137961/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- This paper predicts COVID-19 status using a support vector machine modeling on individual's symptoms. The dataset was composed of 200 individual's data with 8 different symptoms\": temperature, breathing rate, hypertension, stage heart beat rate, acute respiratory distress syndrome, chest pain, heart disease and cough with sputum. The modeling attempted to categorize individuals into three different classes: not infected, mildly infected, and severely infected. They used a linear SVM model and a 70/30 training/test split. The modeling yielded an overall accuracy of 87 percent, with class results showing the severely infected class with a precision  of 0.94, recall of 1.00, and f1 of 0.97. The not infected and mildly infected classes were lower. SVM performed best on this dataset when compared to k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, random forest, and AdaBoost."

    "- This paper takes a look at corporate credit ratings and examines the models that best forecast them. The data used in this paper covered 52 different financial firms from 1990 through 2018. There were also 28 energy companies and 44 healthcare companies examined for years 2009 through 2018.  A total of 16 different metrics were used in order to predict finacial sector ratings. While 20 ratio metrics were used for the energy and healthcare sectors. For the ratings there are 19 different classes from AAA through CC. The data was split for 70/10/20 for train/validate/test sets. When using SVM the authors used one vs. one and one vs. all for the categorization.  Bagged Decision Tree performance the best for credit predictions for the financial and healthcare firms examined, while the energy sector was best predicted by Random Forest modeling.

The spllit the data into 80/20 for training/testing. For both models the team vectorizes the word data sets for numeric values suing TfidfVectorizer. The models are then trained. The SVM model achieves an accuracy of about ~91 percent on the test set with strong precision recall and f1. The decision tree reaches ~61 percent accuracy.  The article states that in this setting SVM outperforms the decision tree across accuracy precision recall and f1, and explains that SVMs are well suited to high-dimensional text features whereas decision trees are simpler and more interpretable.\n",

In the data roughly 75 percent made on time payments, while one quarter were late on payments and defaulted. About 3,000 samples were used, however there is no mention of the training test split in the article. The modeling techniques yielded a RMSE of 0.44 with the SVM model and one of 0.42 with the decision tree model. Essentially, the decision tree model performed better with this dataset, having lower error rates."

SPecifically, when looking at ROC_AUC the RBF SVM model with C at 2 and gamma at 0.06 obtained a score of 0.7956 (79.56%). The runner up was \"svm_rbf_C3_g0.04\", the RBF SVM model with C at 3 and gamma at 0.04, obtained a ROC_AUC score of 79.52%.\n",

The scores are very similar, but the Random Forest model is better.\n",

    "#### Which algorithm is recommended to get more accurate results?\n",
    "- Overall, the best performing model accross Assignment 2 and Assignment 3, was the Random Forest #3 model. WIth the highest scores for roc-auc. So the recommended model is rand_forest_3 from assignment 2, not any SVM model from Assignment 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Is it better for classification or regression scenarios?\n",
    "- This data exercise was a classification scenario, the decision tree model did perform better, just slightly, as the top SVM model was a close runner up. It seems SVm is well equiped to handle categorization scenarions, while decision trees are pretty well equipped to handle either or. This secnario had an imbalanced target and also a decent amount of tabular data, which may have impacted its higher results. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Do you agree with the recommendations? Why?\n",
    "- Yes, i agree that the recommendation based on these results would be to suggest a decision tree, more specifically a random forest modeling methodology, as it obtained better results. However, that being said the SVM methodology did obtain a very close second place score. Additionally, when looking at the papers reviewed for this assignment, nearly all of the papers found that specific deicison tree methodologies out performed the SVM methodologies for perdicitve modeling on the data. In each of the researched papers, with the exception of the text classification scenario where SVM performed better, the decision tree methodologies were best. In conclusion, for thie scenario, where the issues isnt text classification, but rather more tabular data with imbalanced outcomes for reference, decision trees are better thant SVMs. "
